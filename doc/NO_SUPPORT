As of version 1.9, I (Koen gadeyne) will no longer continue development or
support of the SVGATextMode package (perhaps barring important bug fixes).

Unless someone takes over, this means SVGATextMode is, well... "dead".

Reasons for this decision are:

* reduced interest in SVGATextMode, as hardware is getting so fast and
  memory so abundant that running Xwindows all of the time is no longer a
  problem. Older machines not comfortable with X are generally supported by
  STM. 
  
* Linux 2.2 (and newer versions) contain kernel support for graphical
  textmodes (vesafb). Although it uses a totally different approach than
  STM, it can replace most of its functionality.
  
* it is getting more and more difficult to get suitable documentation from
  VGA chip makers, especially for a niche product as SVGATextMode. Even the
  XFree86 people are running into this obstacle every day. It is impossible
  to write an SVGATextMode driver without those docs.
  
* It is also extremely difficult to write a good driver for hardware I don't
  have. I obviously don't want to buy every new VGA card, and donations are
  extremely rare (I count ONE in the four years of STM's existence).
  
* most recent VGA cards are very louzy textmode performers. Actually all the
  ones I could check are bad. This is due to the use of synchronous
  memories, as explained in the FAQ. This means an STM driver is less and
  less attractive compared to a graphical solution like the linux VESAFB.
  Modern VGA controllers are much more difficult to set up. More work for
  less results? Hmm...
  
* GGI, if it ever matures, will also be able to replace STM, and it will
  actually be much less of a risk in terms of screwing up your text
  console...
  
* ... and some less technical reasons :-)
