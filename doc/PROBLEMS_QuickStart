Most problems with SVGATextMode are related to clock selection. If your
screen goes nuts, it means that SVGATextMode (or you!) made a mistake when
selecting a clock.

95% of SVGATextMode problems reported to me get the reply "TRY GRABMODE!"

Grabmode allows you to measure the pixel clock that is ACTUALLY used, not
the one SVGATextMode _thinks_ it uses.


These are the three most complained-about things about SVGATextMode:

1) SVGATextMode doesn't know how to program the clock on your VGA chip,
   because it is not (yet) supported.
   
2) You entered the wrong "clocks" line, or, worse even, you just used the
   example clocks line in the example TextConfig file, despite the numerous
   warnings allover the documentation not to do so.

3) You are attempting to use a pixel clock that is too high. First try using
   lower clocks (i.e. < 40 MHz)


RTFM note: these three things are discussed in detail in the documentation...


Use grabmode before you start complaining. It'll save you (and me) a lot of
trouble.
