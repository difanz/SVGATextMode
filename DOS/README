General notes about the SVGATextmode DOS port:

 Don't expect that most programs run in your custom resolution.

 But "good" programs do:
 Examples: QEdit, List (Buerg), Emacs, JED, joe ... (Most likely any
 Unix-programs ported to DOS with DJGPP will work...)

 STM uses BIOS-functions to load a font with correct size. BIOS
 only supports font height of 8/14/16. 

Some info about compiling STM from SVGATextmode in DOS with DJGPP:

 - unpack the source package (SVGATextMode-x.y-src.tar.gz)
   with djtarx (part of the djdev* package).

 - First copy config.bat to the main SVGATextmode-source directory
   Start config.bat there to configure makefile. (SED needed)

 - Second, you have to rebuild the dependecy file: "make dep"

 - Then just run make (no "DOS" target selecting necessary).
   Everything should compile right now.
   (At least if you have sed, flex and yacc installed...)

 If you have any problems compiling STM with DJGPP feel free to

Update: January 2006

Nearly 10 years later, you might also contact me ;)
The update was neccessary, because a number of Linux-patches spoiled
the ability to compile for DOS. Also, some things were still buggy or very
quick'n'dirty (e.g. location of config-file). No wonder I could not find
any binary of this goodie on the net. But now I have my beloved 100x75-mode
also within DOS and I learnt a lot about sending in patches, too.
Cheers to Ron (ron@debian.org) for that!

By the way, I use a Cross-DJGPP (V2.04 needed because of 'snprintf') to 
compile STM. Still, the above explanation should still work for a plain 
DOS-DJGPP. You just need a whole bunch of GNU-Tools for that to work.
