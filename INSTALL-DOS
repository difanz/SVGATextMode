                Installing the SVGATextMode utility for DOS
                -------------------------------------------

... is simple.

- Copy the STMText.cfg file to your PATH, and edit it according to your
  configuration. Calling external programs is supported, too. 
  
- Copy the executables to any place you like, as long as you (or the PATH
  variable) can find it back.

Don't forget to read the documentation in the "doc" directory!

If you get messages about a not-supported chipset or incomplete driver,
please contact Wolfram Sang (ninja@the-dreams.de). In most cases, it 
might be possible to add support - just testers are needed :)

And in case you know a font-loading tool which can handle font-sizes
besides 8x8/14/16, please contact Wolfram, too.
