The files in this directory are here only as an example! The entire font
loading package can either be found as the "keytbls" package in the "n.."
directories of the ever-popular Slackware distribution, or as
"kbd-0.91.tar.gz" (or newer version) on many Linux FTP sites.


Some extra fonts (contributed by Massimiliano Ghilardi and Michele Maltoni)
are:

8x6 : A _very_ short font for people that always say 'I want more lines on my
      screen'

9x14 and 9x16 : Standard fonts, enlarged to take full advantage of the 
                nine-bit-wide VGA font cells
