This is a SYSV style init script for SVGATextMode.  It sets to
specific text mode and then changes back to 80x25 on shutdown.  To make it
work on a SYSVInit / RedHat machine either:

install as /etc/rc.d/init.d/svgatextmode
cd /etc/rc.d
for i in 3 4 5; do ln -s ../init.d/svgatextmode rc$i.d/S83svgatextmode; done
for i in 0 6; do ln -s ../init.d/svgatextmode rc$i.d/K05svgatextmode ; done

	or 

install as /etc/rc.d/init.d/svgatextmode
for i in 0 6; do ln -s rc$i.d/K05svgatextmode ../init.d/svgatextmode
Run TkSYSV (runlevel editor) from the control panel and add it to your
favourite modes.

83 is chosen because it's after gpm so no restart of that is needed.

# SVGATextMode
#
# This must be executed *after* /usr is mounted.
# This means is /usr is NFS-mounted, it needs to
# run after networking and NFS mounts are up.

# description: this changes the screen sizing.  Since SVGATextMode can
# use the first clock on a video card (the normal text one) it's
# important to return to the default video mode before shutdown so
# that dos then works correctly.
