This program can be dangerous: if you use it to adjust scan
frequencies outside what your monitor can handle, hardware damage can
be the result.  In particular, if you adjust the image until the
monitor can no longer keep the picture still, you could cause the
monitor to overheat and eventually burn out.  This will normally not
be a problem if you stop running in this mode within a few seconds.

LEMIS will not be responsible for any such damage.  Read the man page
for more details.
